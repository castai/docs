# API specification

Our API contract is published as OpenAPI v3 specification. You can check it on our
Swagger UI:

<https://api.cast.ai/v1/spec/>

This will bring you to our current specification. Here you will be able to familiarize yourself with available APIs
and try functionality directly in the browser.

!!! note ""
    To try out APIs in the browser you will need an API access key.
    See [Authentication](../api/authentication.md).

We do not maintain any public SDKs but you can generate an API client for your programming language using many of the [OpenAPI generators](https://openapi.tools/#sdk). Use below JSON as a spec:

<https://api.cast.ai/v1/spec/openapi.json>

!!! note ""
    OpenAPI is widely supported. Many tools (e.g. Postman) allow importing OpenAPI definitions as well. See
    documentation for your REST tooling to find out more.
