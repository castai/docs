# Welcome to CAST AI

It is one platform that cuts your cloud costs, boosts DevOps, and prevents downtime.

## Easy to start

First, connect your cluster to CAST AI and see how much you can save by optimizing cluster configuration. After exploring the available savings and cost reports, you can onboard the cluster into CAST AI and set the [Autoscaler](./product-overview/console/autoscaler.md) policies, which will manage the cluster for you. It takes less than 5 minutes to fully onboard a cluster, please follow [the guide to learn more](getting-started/overview.md).

CAST AI abstracts layers of technical complexity from the user, so there is little knowledge required to use the product:

- basics of running Kubernetes cluster in the public cloud (AWS, GCP, AKS)
- working knowledge of `kubectl` command line utility for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters
